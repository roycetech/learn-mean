/**
The way that it is now, we are allowing new cities to be created with a blank description.
Let's add some validation so that in order for a city to be created, its description must
have a string length greater than 4.

Tasks:
1. Add an if block that checks for a description.length greater than 4,
and move our city creation logic into that block. Use json() to send the
results from createCity back to the client.
2. If description does not match its minimum length requirements, then
set a 400 status code (Bad Request) to the response, and set the response
body to Invalid City using json().

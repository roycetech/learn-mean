<!--
In our client below, listen for 'question' events from the server and call the insertQuestion function whenever the event fires.

Tasks:
First, listen for 'question' events from the server.
Now, have the event callback function call the insertQuestion function. The insertQuestion function is already created for you, and it's placed in its own file. It expects exactly one argument - the question.

<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>

<script>
  var server = io.connect('http://localhost:8080');

  // Insert code here
  server.on('question', function (data) {
    insertQuestion(data);
  });

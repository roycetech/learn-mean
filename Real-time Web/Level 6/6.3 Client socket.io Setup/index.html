<!--
In our html file, load the socket.io.js script and connect to the socket.io server.

Tasks:
Load the socket.io.js script. The socket.io.js path you should use is '/socket.io/socket.io.js'. Express knows to serve the socket.io client js for this path.
Using the global io object that's now available for us, connect to the socket.io server at http://localhost:8080.

-->

<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
<script>
  // use the socket.io server to connect to localhost:8080 here
   var socket = io.connect('http://localhost:8080');
</script>

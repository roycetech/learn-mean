// Let's create a route that accepts dynamic arguments in the URL path and responds with the quote from the proper author.


// Tasks:
// Start by creating a GET route for '/quotes' that takes a name parameter as part of the URL path.
// Now, use the name parameter from the URL to retrieve a quote from the quotes object and write it out to the response. Note: No piping here, just write the quote string to the response like you did in previous levels (and then close the response).
